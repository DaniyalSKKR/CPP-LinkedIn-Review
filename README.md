C++ is one of the most popular programming languages today, and this course enables you to check how your skills measure up. Instructor Eduardo Corpeño presents a series of programming challenges to help you practice. Learn how to use GitHub Codespaces with the course, then dive into the challenges, beginning with checking for palindromes and sorting an array and continuing through to more advanced challenges like JSON file validation and the birthday problem. You can move through the challenges at your own pace, in order or searching for particular challenges you want to complete.
